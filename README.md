# Yet Another Vanilla Plus Mod
## Blocks
### Igneous Stone Set
Granite, Diorite and Andesite now have Cobbled variants, allowing them to be used for crafting. In addition,
the normal igneous stones can now be crafted into Bricks and Tiles!
## Mobs
### ![Face of a Crimson Moongus](src/main/resources/readme/moongus.png) Moongus
This weirdly cute little Mooshroom variant lives in the Crimson and Warped Forests of the Nether.
Since they're infested with Nether Wart, they can be milked for potions with a Glass Bottle,
similar to how their Overworld cousins can be milked for Mushroom and Suspicious Stews with
a bowl. **Crimson Moongi produce awkward potions**, so you can feed them brewing ingredients to apply an effect to the Potion.
**For potions that cannot be brewed in an Awkard Potion, you can feed the ingredients to a Warped Moongus** instead of a Crimson Moongus.
